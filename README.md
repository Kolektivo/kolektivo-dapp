# Kolektivo dApp

## Overview

This repository contains the frontend of the Kolektivo distributed application (dApp), which is currently under development. 

The Kolektivo dApp is being developed for the Kolektivo Framework, which is a collection of institutional technologies that open up new opportunities for local communities to govern and finance their own regenerative economies.

The dApp is bootstrapped by theÂ [Aurelia 2.0](https://github.com/aurelia/new) framework.  It is written mostly in Typescript, HTML and SCSS, and is bundled using Vite.  It will initially be deployed on the [Celo Layer-1 Blockchain](https://celo.org/).
